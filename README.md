<img align="right" src="Documentation/Logo/Marlin%20Logo%20GitHub.png" />

  * Compiling and flashing:
    * [Linux](Documentation/Linux_Compilation.md)
    * [Windows](Documentation/Windows_Compilation.md)
  * [Supported GCodes](Documentation/GCodes.md)

## Quick Information

This is a firmware for reprap single-processor electronics setups, but this particular fork is specifically suited for [BQ printers](http://bq.com/3d-world). 

Based on [Marlin](https://github.com/ErikZalm/Marlin), from Erik Zalm, this firmware is a mashup between [Sprinter](https://github.com/kliment/Sprinter), [grbl](https://github.com/simen/grbl) and many original parts.

See the [changelog](Documentation/Changelog.md) file for version details.

## Licence

Marlin is published under the [GPL license](Documentation/COPYING.md) because I believe in open development.
Please do not use this code in products (3D printers, CNC etc) that are closed source or are crippled by a patent.
